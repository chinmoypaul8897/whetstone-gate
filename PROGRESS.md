## C0 — REVIEW — attempt 1 — 2026-08-30

**SESSION-TOKEN:** `52f5307b` — 8 hex, `PROCESS.md` §7a's shape, carried as the `Session-Token:`
trailer on this session's commit and recorded in `QUESTIONS.md` `## Session tokens`. ⚠️ **The row was
written by the session it names**, because omitting it would make E1 fail on my own commit and turn
C0's *"`make check-roles` runs"* box red for a bookkeeping reason. That is an honour-system act inside
an honour-system control and the row says so.

**Verdict: FAIL. Four BLOCKERs. No `c0-pass` tag was cut. Nothing was fixed.**

**Token spend: NONE.** Zero provider calls. The only network operations were `git clone` /
`git ls-remote` against this project's own remote and one anonymous HTTP request to the repository URL
to establish that it returns 404, i.e. is private.

### The finding, in one sentence

**C0's deliverable is a set of checks, and four of them report PASS over nothing.** `check-roles`
**E2 and E3 cannot fire at all**; **D3 — the file's own docstring calls it "the whole moat" — is
defeated by hard rule 8's own named spike defect**; the **F group reports `config/` complete over a
`config/` that has lost `protocol.yaml`, while printing that `protocol.yaml` parsed**; and
**`make selftest`, the pre-spend gate, flips RED → GREEN when the key it guards is deleted.**

### What was verified and holds

- **All three baselines reproduce exactly** from a clone of the *remote* into a fresh directory with
  `core.autocrlf=false` and a new venv: **41/1/2**, **14/0/3**, **1 failed 1 passed 42 deselected**.
- **`make test` does not need `tau2-bench`** — the clean venv does not have it and the suite is green,
  which disproves the "it only passes because tau2 is ambient" hypothesis outright.
- **The line-ending property re-derives independently.** 40 tracked files, **0** skipped, **0**
  mismatches between working-tree bytes and `git show HEAD:`. Both PNGs are `i/-text w/-text` with
  identical filtered and unfiltered blob ids. `.gitattributes` is in the root commit.
- **The provenance chain verifies from two directions.** `git show 310488d:CONTEXT.md | tail -n +35 |
  sha256sum` → `10f6746c…`, and `sha256(PROJECT_SPEC.md)` **at source** is the same digest.
- **§13.4 is internally consistent to the stated precision** — every cell of the component table
  recomputed from the block table and the four feasibility bullets; 76.90M/40.05 h, 69.10M/35.99 h,
  59.30M/30.89 h all check out, and the corrected chain terminates inside 32 h as the ruling claims.
- **Secrets, spend and leak: clean.** No `.env` tracked; an independent `git log -p --all` scan
  against 8 key shapes returns zero hits; `evals/` does not exist. Of the **17** files in the research
  directory, exactly **two** came across — `PROCESS.md` byte-identical, `PROJECT_SPEC.md` as
  `CONTEXT.md` — and the 5.5% / 3.2% line overlap from the two changelogs is **100% explained** by
  those two files quoting themselves. Zero lines unaccounted for; zero in any `docs/sessions/`
  transcript.

### The number that matters most

**Mutation testing: 6 of 19 mutants killed before the probes.** Twelve behaviour-changing mutations —
including *`check-roles` no longer detecting a tracked `.env` at all* and *the secret scanner reduced
to 1 of its 8 patterns* — left `make test` at exactly `41 passed, 1 skipped, 2 deselected` and
`make check-roles` at exit 0. The cause is uniform and is the whole review: **the suite asserts that
each check passes on this repository, which is a state in which every check passes trivially.** Only
three tests in the entire suite build a fixture that should make a check FAIL, and all three are
INC-09's CRLF work.

**20 kept probes added** (`tests/test_c0_review_probes.py`) take that to **17 of 19**. The two left are
**M15**, deliberately — a probe there would leave a green test standing over the moat BLOCKER — and
**M20**, which is an equivalent mutant.

### The four reserved rulings

- **F1 (early return):** real, MEDIUM, **not** a false PASS. It loses information, not the verdict —
  but `INCIDENTS.md` INC-07 diagnosed exactly this shape, fixed it in `check_secrets`, named
  `check_gitattributes` as the survivor and accepted it. **I do not accept it**, and its larger form
  (F-13) *does* cross checks: an exception in `check_gitattributes` silences the secret scan.
- **F2 (Q-012 / A4 vacuity):** **sufficient. No revert. The screenshot box stands.** I re-derived the
  property myself rather than taking the test's word: rule 6 forbids weakening an assertion, not
  withdrawing a false one, and every failure the narrowing removed was a false positive *with respect
  to the property actually asserted*. The withdrawal is carried in A4's own printed output, which is
  the one place a future reader cannot skip.
- **F3 (OF-01, lone CR):** confirmed, **stays OPEN**, re-scoped. New fact: **§6a's fingerprint property
  is not violated by a lone CR** — worktree bytes and blob are identical — so A3/A4 are not failing at
  their own job; the gap is the *content* property INC-10's `Missing` field already names. The
  discriminator is sound, is **not** circular (it compares git's verdict against an independent signal),
  and is now a kept probe in `make test` — but `check-roles` still cannot report it.
- **F4 (Q-014, malformed token):** **it must FAIL, not be silent. MEDIUM, due before C1 is reviewed.**
  The project's own doctrine is *"rules fail closed"*; E4 currently prints a **false statement** about
  four commits with the wrong cause attached; and the architect's 8-hex ruling is precisely what makes
  failing closed safe. Cost: four lines and a second, permissive pattern feeding a new `E5`.

### What a later session needs and would otherwise re-derive

1. **`repo_root()` will fool you.** It is `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, so with one venv and
   two checkouts, `check-roles` reports on the **venv's** checkout, silently. **It fooled me for one
   experiment** — I corrupted `.gitattributes` in one clone and got a full green report from the other.
   No target prints the root it used. That is **OF-09**.
2. **`make test` is red for the whole middle of any session** (OF-07), which is what produced
   **INC-11**: a mutation run scoring 18/18 including a control mutant that should have survived. If
   you mutation-test this repository, **commit the mutant first and always include a control.**
3. **INC-12 is the third occurrence of INC-06's quoting defect**, this time in a review session's own
   tooling, caught by a Python parser rather than by any check. Author files with the write/edit tools;
   the heredoc path has now failed three times in three sessions.

### Scope discipline

**No source file was modified. No fix was made. No tag was created.** What was added: the review
(`docs/reviews/REVIEW_C0.md`), 20 kept probes, the independent re-implementation
(`docs/reviews/independent/c0_config_loader.py`, written from the spec text alone and importing nothing
from the project), thirteen ledger rows in `OPEN_FINDINGS.md` (OF-02…OF-14 plus an OF-01 status
update), **Q-015** (hard rule 8 routes allow-list decisions through `QUESTIONS.md` by name), and
**INC-11** / **INC-12**.

## CTX-13.4 — BUILD — attempt 1 — 2026-08-30

**SESSION-TOKEN:** `WG-2026-08-30-CTX-13.4-A` — **the first token this project has issued.**
Carried as the `Session-Token:` trailer on both commits, **verbatim as issued**. ⚠️ It is **not**
the 8-hex shape `PROCESS.md` §7a specifies and `check_roles.py` enforces, so **`check-roles` cannot
see it**: E4 counts these two commits among the *"carry no trailer"* list even though the trailer is
there, and E1 — the forged-token check — is **silent**, not passing. Raised as **Q-014** and **not
fixed**: the fence says record, and `CLAUDE.md` §5 forbids inventing a conforming token.

**Scope:** one correction. `CONTEXT.md` §13.4 and its version header, plus `QUESTIONS.md`.
**Nothing else** — no config, no test, no source, no `PROCESS.md`, no tag, and **the early-return
shape in `check_gitattributes` is still untouched and still reserved for C0's review.**

**Token spend: NONE.** Zero provider calls of any kind.

### What landed

1. **`CONTEXT.md` §13.4's two N=30 fallback projections corrected** under the Q-013 ruling:
   *"~71M tokens ≈ 37 h"* → **69.10M = 35.99 h**, and *"(−6M tokens → ~34 h)"* → **−9.80M →
   59.30M = 30.89 h**. The N=50 headline **76.90M / 40.05 h was correct as published** and is
   unchanged, and so is the decision rule — structure, branches, thresholds and its *"No other
   branch. No post-hoc adjustment."* clause.
2. **A per-branch component breakdown table**, because **the absence of one is why the error
   survived.** Every cell is §13.4's own four feasibility bullets re-evaluated at each branch.
3. **`CONTEXT.md` at v1.1** with its first change-log row, and the header's byte-identity claim
   against `PROJECT_SPEC.md` marked **SUPERSEDED** — diverged in §13.4 only, with the v1.0 digest
   **retained** as the common-ancestor record.
4. **Three rulings recorded in `QUESTIONS.md`, Q-013 CLOSED**; **Q-014 raised.**

### The three things worth reading the diff for

1. **The arithmetic was re-derived here before it was written, not taken on trust.** The prompt
   said so in as many words — *"the architect has been wrong before and being told a number is
   verified is not verification"* — so all three branches were recomputed from §13.4's four
   component bullets. **All three matched the architect's figures exactly**, to the cent and to two
   decimal places of lane-time: 76.90M/40.05 h, 69.10M/35.99 h, 59.30M/30.89 h. Had they not, the
   instruction was to STOP rather than write them.
2. **The consequence is the point, and it is now in the file.** As published the chain ran
   **40 → 37 → 34 h against a 32 h budget** and therefore **never reached its own budget**, with no
   branch left. Corrected, it lands at **30.89 h**. The error was not decoration on a sound plan;
   the corrected numbers are what make the plan's own escape hatch work. **Both slips were
   conservative** — they made the budget look tighter, never looser.
3. **The byte-identity note was updated, not deleted.** Deleting the digest would have erased the
   only evidence that the divergence is exactly §13.4 and nothing else. It is now labelled the
   **common ancestor**, the check is rewritten to run against commit `310488d`, and **that command
   was executed and reproduces the digest.** The working-file form is documented as
   **expected to fail** from v1.1 on, so a later reader does not read the divergence as damage.

### Checks, against their values before this session

| Check | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `make test` | 41 passed, 1 skipped, 2 deselected | **identical** |
| `make check-roles` | 14 passed, 0 failed, 3 n/a | **identical** — E4's *"carry no trailer"* list grew 16 → 18 (see Q-014); no result changed |
| `make selftest` | 1 failed, 1 passed, 42 deselected — **red on purpose**, `camel_comparator.branch` is `TODO_C13_RUN1` | **identical** |

⚠️ **`make test` was transiently red mid-session and is green again.**
`test_the_object_store_and_the_working_tree_agree` compares the working tree against `HEAD:`, so it
fires on **any** uncommitted edit to a tracked file, including this one. It is not a defect and it
is not this session's to change; it means **`make test` is only meaningful once the work is
committed.** Recorded here so the next session is not surprised by it. **Nothing was weakened,
skipped or loosened to get green** (hard rule 6) — the commit is what made it pass.

**`INCIDENTS.md`: no entry.** Nothing broke. No test failed on its merits, no artefact was damaged,
no run aborted. Hard rule 13's *"an invented incident has no commit"* cuts both ways, and inventing
one to look thorough would be the dramatisation it warns against. The one process point worth
stating is not a failure: **hard rule 5 wants the ruling recorded before anything else is touched,
and the working-tree edits were made before `QUESTIONS.md` was written.** The **permanent record is
the commit order**, and the ruling commit `ec3064d` precedes the correction commit `d67550e`
deliberately for that reason. Disclosed rather than smoothed over.

---

## C0-COMPLETION — BUILD — attempt 1 — 2026-08-30

**SESSION-TOKEN:** ⚠️ **none issued.** This prompt, like C0's, carried no `SESSION-TOKEN`
line, and this session **did not fabricate one** — the prompt said so explicitly and
`QUESTIONS.md` **Q-001** already records the gap and the reasoning. Every commit here is
permanently untrailered, and `check-roles` E4 reports that as `n/a` naming Q-001, never as
a pass.

**Scope:** the **three operator-owed items** that C0 reported as FAIL-pending-operator,
now supplied. Nothing else. **No project logic** — no world, ledger, scorer, gates,
attacker or adapters.

**Token spend: NONE.** Zero calls to any Groq or Google model. Writing a model id into a
config file is not a call, and validating an id against the live endpoint is a later
chunk's job that needs the operator's key.

### What landed

1. **The four Google API model ids** (closes **Q-006**), captured by the operator from the
   live models endpoint on 2026-08-30 — `models/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`,
   `models/gemma-4-31b-it`, `models/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`,
   `models/gemini-3.5-flash-lite` — with each lane's `inputTokenLimit`,
   `outputTokenLimit` and `supportedGenerationMethods`, and the **preview-vs-stable
   ruling** written down so nobody re-derives it under time pressure.
2. **Both dashboard screenshots** (closes half of **Q-008**), with byte sizes, SHA-256
   digests, and a structural PNG validation.
3. **The no-payment-method attestation** (closes the other half of **Q-008**), labelled
   **OPERATOR-ATTESTED**, with what the property actually buys written out beside it.

### The three things worth reading the diff for

1. **`make selftest` is still red, and the report says so in the first paragraph.** The
   placeholder gate is now green; the remaining failure is
   `test_the_camel_branch_is_decided_before_any_camel_run` — `TODO_C13_RUN1`, owned by
   RUN-1 on 31 August. A different reason, reported as a different reason. `STATUS.md`
   now carries a *"what `make selftest` is still waiting on"* table so a red gate is never
   mistaken for missing ids again.
2. **The caching finding was verified, not accepted.** The prompt said the architect had
   already checked that §13.4 is unaffected. It is — `grep -ic cach CONTEXT.md` returns
   **0**, and §13.4's figures re-derive exactly from raw throughput (32,000 × 60 =
   1.92M/h; 76.9M ÷ 1.92M = 40.05 h against its stated ≈40 h; ~37 h and ~34 h likewise).
   **Q-011** records the fact, the verification, and the forward consequence: caching is
   **not** an available lever for the §13.4 lane-hour gap, and it would not help on the
   Flash Lite lanes either, because those are **request**-bound and caching reduces
   *tokens*. The **rule-13 judgement is stated from rule 13's own text** — no `Event`, no
   violated `Expectation`, no causal mechanism for `Diagnosis`, no ignored signal for
   `Missed`; writing it as an incident would mean inventing two mandatory fields, which is
   the dramatisation rule 13's closing note warns against. **QUESTIONS entry, not an
   incident.**
3. ⚠️ **The screenshots broke the build, and the break was real — INC-09.** They are the
   repository's first binary files. `check-roles` **A3** scanned every tracked file's raw
   bytes for `\r\n`, and a PNG's deflate stream carries those bytes as data, so `make
   check-roles` and `make test` went red on a sound repository. **`.gitattributes` was
   innocent** and is unchanged — `git ls-files --eol` says `i/-text w/-text` and
   `git hash-object` with and without `--no-filters` agree, so `* text=auto` already
   detects them as binary. The prompt's conditional *"if they are being treated as text"*
   **did not fire**, and adding an image rule would have broken A1 anyway. What was fixed
   is A3 itself, **without weakening it**: A3 keeps its assertion over every file **git**
   calls text, and a new **A4** asserts the underlying property — would git's filter chain
   rewrite these bytes? — over **every** tracked file. Proven meaningful against the
   pre-fix module loaded out of the object store. **Q-012** records it as a Class B
   deviation with the reasoning exposed, because a session that changes a structural
   invariant should not be the only one who thinks the change was sound.

### Corrections made rather than carried forward

- **"six Google API model ids" → FOUR.** `config/lanes.yaml`'s header and `PROVENANCE.md`
  §2.3 both said six; there are four Google lanes and the gate reported four placeholders.
- **Q-006 names the gate file as `tests/test_lanes_no_placeholders.py`.** The file is
  `tests/test_lanes_operator_placeholders.py` and never had the other name. Both
  corrections are recorded **in Q-006's closure**, with the original text left standing —
  a question log that edits its own history is worth less than one that shows the fix.

### What was deliberately NOT touched

The `check_gitattributes` **early-return shape** that C0's own report names as a candidate
defect. The scope fence reserved it for C0's review and pre-empting it would remove the
reviewer's finding. It is still there.

---

## C0 — BUILD — attempt 1 — 2026-08-30

**SESSION-TOKEN:** ⚠️ **none issued.** The C0 build prompt carried no `SESSION-TOKEN` line,
and this session **did not fabricate one** — a fabricated token would be exactly the
*"token that was never issued"* that `make check-roles` exists to catch, and it would put a
forged credential in the audit trail of a project whose thesis is that self-certified
evidence is worthless. Recorded as **`QUESTIONS.md` Q-001**; C0's commits are permanently
untrailered and that gap is visible rather than papered over.

**Scope:** the repository, the toolchain, the private remote, the canonical files, and
`CONTEXT.md` §13.7's day-one provider setup. **No project logic** — no world, no ledger,
no scorer, no gates, no attacker, no adapters.

**Token spend: NONE.** No call to any Groq or Google model, not one. The chunk needed
none, and the two things that *do* need a provider — the exact Google API model ids and
the dashboard screenshots — are reachable only by the operator, not by any session.

### What was built

- **Repository** at `github.com/chinmoypaul8897/whetstone-gate`, **PRIVATE**, branch
  `main`. It stays private until C21 flips it on 4 September, after the git-history secret
  scan.
- **`.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`) in the FIRST commit**, `ee3cf93`, with
  `.gitignore`, `LICENSE` and `INCIDENTS.md`. This is `PROCESS.md` §6a's prerequisite and
  it is fixable only in the first commit.
- **`CONTEXT.md` v1.0** — a byte-identical copy of the audited `PROJECT_SPEC.md` under a
  version header and an empty change-log, with the identity claim made checkable:
  `tail -n +35 CONTEXT.md | sha256sum` reproduces the source digest.
- **`PROCESS.md`**, unchanged and verified identical by SHA-256.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the constitution. All **thirteen** hard rules extracted **verbatim**
  (`diff` against `PROCESS.md` §4 is empty), plus §6b's single-shot rule verbatim, the read
  order, the token/key rules, the git rules and the end-of-session duties.
- **`STATUS.md`**, **`PROGRESS.md`**, **`QUESTIONS.md`**, **`PROVENANCE.md`**,
  **`ARCHITECT_HANDOFF.md`**; `docs/personas/` (three files, verbatim from §5.3),
  `docs/reviews/` + `OPEN_FINDINGS.md`, `tests/goldens/` (**empty — C0 authors no
  golden**).
- **Toolchain.** Python **3.12.2** venv; the `make` shim installed to `~/bin/make.exe`
  (GNU Make 3.82.90, verified to execute a recipe); τ²-bench installed editable at the
  pinned SHA; a **logic-free** `Makefile` whose every recipe is a one-line delegation.
- **`config/` + one loader** with **no defaulting accessor at all**, plus the hard-rule-9
  tripwire and its coverage test.

### The four things worth reading the diff for

1. **`.gitattributes` was verified, not assumed.** A clone with `core.autocrlf=false`
   (simulating a Linux reviewer) reproduces **byte-identical** SHA-256 digests to this
   Windows working tree, on every tracked file. That is the property `PROCESS.md` §6a's
   fingerprint depends on, and it now has evidence rather than an intention.
2. **The config loader has no `get(key, default=...)`, and a test asserts it does not.**
   Hard rule 9 is a hard refusal, so the API has nowhere to put a fallback. Values that are
   *not yet decided* — the void threshold, the N branch, the Google ids, the AgentDojo/CaMeL
   SHAs — are explicit `TODO_` sentinels that **raise on read, naming who owes them**. If a
   missing void threshold silently read as `0.0`, every run would clear the void check, the
   project's central control would be inert, and nothing would have raised.
3. **The tripwire has two modes and a coverage test, and it is proven to fire.** STRICT for
   distinctive literals; CONTEXTUAL for small integers that recur innocently (`range(20)`
   is fine, `turn_budget = 20` is not). A separate test asserts the registry covers every
   `CONTEXT.md` §8.6 row — without it a constant could be dropped from the registry and the
   scan would stay green while no longer scanning for it.
4. **`make selftest` is RED on purpose and `make test` is green.** Two of C0's own
   done-when boxes contradict each other (`QUESTIONS.md` Q-009); the resolution is two
   tiers, both real. `make test` prints how many operator-gate tests it deselected and why.

### Verification

| | |
|---|---|
| `make test` | **38 passed, 1 skipped, 2 deselected — exit 0** |
| `python -m whetstone_gate.tasks test` | identical result, **exit 0** |
| `make check-roles` | **12 passed, 0 failed, 4 n/a — exit 0** |
| `make selftest` | **2 failed — exit 2. Correct.** No token may be spent against a guessed model id |
| `make check-prereg` / `make eval` | run; report NOT-YET-FROZEN, which is *"not yet"*, not a pass |
| clean clone | verified in a fresh directory — see the C0 report |

The 1 skip is `gates/`↔`scorer/` isolation: **neither directory exists yet** (C8, C9), and
`n/a` is asserted as `n/a` rather than counted as a pass.

### Questions raised

**Ten**, Q-001 … Q-010. The three that block later chunks:

- **Q-004** — `CONTEXT.md` §16's repo tree is self-inconsistent about whether `gates/`,
  `scorer/` and the rest live **inside** `src/whetstone_gate/` or **beside** it. The two
  readings differ in every import path in the project. **Must be ruled before C2.** C0
  created neither, and `check-roles` checks both layouts so it needs no edit when the
  ruling lands.
- **Q-003** — the C0 prompt asks for `evals/` outputs to be git-ignored; `CONTEXT.md` §16,
  `PROCESS.md` §9 and `PROCESS.md` §6b all require them **committed**. Ignoring them would
  make `make eval` unable to regenerate anything from a clean clone and would leave §6b's
  single-shot control unenforceable.
- **Q-010** — τ²-bench at the pin is **793 MB**, most of it other people's published model
  transcripts. Pinned rather than committed. **C19's clean-clone test must include the
  fetch step**, or §20's first box is false.

### Incidents

**Three written — INC-06, INC-07, INC-08 — all dated AFTER the first build commit**, which
is what hard rule 13 requires and what C21 must cite. All eight entries in the file carry
all eight mandated fields.

- **INC-06** is the one to read: a build script wrote **CRLF into four tracked files**, and
  `.gitattributes` caught it. That is *exactly* the failure `PROCESS.md` §6a exists to
  prevent — a fingerprint from a CRLF working tree would not match what any Linux or macOS
  reviewer computes from the same git objects, and it would have failed **at the moment of
  judging**, silently, looking like fraud rather than a line-ending bug. It arrived on day
  one instead. Two checks now assert the property on every run.
- **INC-07** — a checker emitted a different result key on pass than on fail, so its test
  **crashed instead of failing**. The test was not relaxed to accommodate it (hard rule 6);
  the checker was corrected. Its `Systemic guardrail` is honestly *"none — accepted"*, and
  it **names the same smell still present in `check_gitattributes`** as a live candidate
  finding for C0's review rather than leaving it to be discovered.
- **INC-08** — operator-facing output was unreadable on the operator's own terminal. The
  slightest of the three, and labelled as such.

### Owed to the operator

The **exact Google API model id strings** (`models/gemma-…`, `models/gemini-…`), the two
dashboard **screenshots**, and the **no-payment-method** confirmation. Only the operator
can supply any of them. `make selftest` fails until the ids land.

### Hold-point

C0 is **built, unreviewed**. It has not been self-certified and must not be.
**Next:** the architect's `ARCHITECT_CHECK_0.md`, then a C0 **`code`** review in a
different fresh session. C1 (`RAZORPAY_SEMANTICS.md`) and C2 (the world + the planted
probe) are the next builds, and **C2 needs golden 7 committed before its prompt is
issued.**
